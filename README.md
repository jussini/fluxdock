# Ummm, what the heck is this?

Simple Electron wrapper for running Flowdock chat at https://www.flowdock.com

# But why?
Flowdock is missing a linux app. While you could use a web ui, opening the links is a bit of a hassle as they would open in the same page as the chat instead of actual browser window.

# Build and run

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

You could also use the electron toolkit to create app package (AppImage, snap)

`npm run dist`
